Welcome to the  OpenWARP webpage
================================
OpenWARP is an open source boundary element simulation tool based on the `NEMOH code <http://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/doku.php/emo/nemoh/start>`_ developed by Ecole Centrale de Nantes. OpenWARP and NEMOH provide the ability to determine the frequency dependent added mass, radiation damping, and excitation coefficients that describe the behavior of a floating or submerged body in a wave field. These coefficients are widely used in conjunction with the Cummins equation :cite:`cummins1962` to model the behavior of wave energy conversion devices, ships, offshore platforms, and other floating structures.

The OpenWARP project was a collaboration between the U.S. Department of Energy 

Code overview
-------------

The OpenWARP project adds a simple meshing capability and graphical user interface to NEMOH (see image below) and also incorporates several feature additions that are described in the :ref:`Documentation` section.
